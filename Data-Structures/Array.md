# Array

## 📖 Definition
An array is a linear data structure that stores multiple elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.That can access using an index.

---

## ⚙️ Key Characteristics
- Fixed size (defined at declaration)
- Indexed access
- Stores elements in order
- Fast access using index
- Indexing starts at 0
- All elements must be of the same data type

---

## 🔧 Basic Operations
- Access
- Insert
- Delete
- Update
- Traverse

---

## Declaration
- int[] arr;
- String[] names;

## Initialization
- arr = new int[5];
  int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5};

---

## ⏱️ Time Complexity
- Access by Index   O(1)
- Search(linear)    O(n)
- Insert(end)       O(1)
- Insert(middle)    O(n)
- Delete            O(n)

--- 

## 📌 Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Memory efficient

---

## ❌ Disadvantages
- Fixed size
- Insertion and deletion are slow. O(n)
- Wasted memory if not fully used.

---

## Real World Applications
- Storing student marks
- Image pixels
- List of products
