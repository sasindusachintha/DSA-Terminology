# Tree

## Definition
A tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It has a root node and zero or more child nodes, forming parent-child relationships.

---

## Key Characteristics
- Non-linear structure
- Has a root node
- Each node can have multiple children
- No cycle
- Exactly one path between ant two nodes

---

## Basic Terminology
- Root - Topmost node of the tree. starting point of traversal.
- Parent - Any node that has childern is called parent node.
- Child - A node connected to a parent is called a child node.
- Leaf node - Node with no children.
- Sibling - Nodes with same parent.
- path - Sequence of nodes connected by edges.
- Edge - Connection between two nodes.
- Ancestor - Nodes in the path from the root to a given node , excluding the node itself.
- Descendant - Nodes that are below a given node in the tree.
- Height of a node - Number of edges in longest path from node to a leaf.
- Height of tree - height of the root node.
- Degree of Node - Number of children a node has.
- Size of Tree - Total number of nodes in the tree.

## Tree Traversal
- Inorder   (LNR)
