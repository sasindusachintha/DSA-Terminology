# Stack

## Definition
A stack is linear data structure and Abstract Data Type that stores elements in Last-In-First-Out order (LIFO) .

---

## Key Characteristics
- Follows LIFO order.
- Insertion and Deletion happens at top.
- Can be implemented using array or linked list.

---

## All Operations
- Push (insert element)
- Pop (remove element)
- Peek/ Top (view top element)
- isEmpty
- isFull
- size
- Display/ Traverse (Display all elements of the stack.  top -> bottom)
- Clear (removes all elements from the stack at once)
- Search
- Peek at Position (returns element at a specific position from the top)

---

## Time Complexity
- Push     O(1)
- Pop      O(1)
- Peek     O(1)
- Search   O(n)

---

## Advantages
- Simple and fast operations
- Efficient memory usage
- Easy to implement

## Disadvantages
- Limited access (Only top element)
- Overflow and underflow issues
- not suitable for searching elements

## Real-World Applications
- Function calls
- Undo/ Redo operations
- Expression evaluation
- Backtracking algorithms
