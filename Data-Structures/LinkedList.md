# Linked List

## Definition
A linked list is linear data structure, a list of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

---

## Key Chcaracteristics
- Dynamic size (can grow or shrink at runtime).
- Non-contiguous memory allocation
- Each element is called a node
- Nodes are connected using pointers or references

---

## Types of Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Double Linked List
- Circular Linked List

---

## Basic Operations
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching

---

## Time Complexity
- Access           O(n)
- Search           O(n)
- Insert(at head)  O(1)
- Delete(at head)  O(1)

---

## Advantages
- Dyanmic size
- Efficient insertion and deletion
- No memory wastage due to fixed size

---

## Disadvantages
- No random access
- Extra memory for pointers
- Slower access compared to arrays

---

## Real-World Applications
- Implementing stacks and queues
- Music playlist navigation
- Undo/ redo functionality
- Memory management
